directories:
-----------
setenv $DS /ebi/services/data/embl/dirsub/ds/
-> currently  for production embl submissions....

scenario:
--------

mail to datasubs from webin-align(who only forward to curator):

process_align.pl <username/password\@instance> <webin directory> <ds_number>

-> selects a new DS# and creates directory $DS/<DS#> 
-> copies new webin align files to $DS/<DS#>
-> loads INFO.TXT file into db

load_align.pl <username/password\@instance> <ds number> [-save]|[-u]

-> checks alignment files
-> report for curator saved into the DS directory
-> if option [-save] is selected: - loads alignment files into the database
                                  - send an email to the submitter
-> if option [-u] is selected: - update both the .aln and .dat files in the DS
                                 directory and the .aln and .dat files in 
                                 the load clob directory 
                                 from the webin_align directory

check_align.pl <username/password\@instance>

-> checks every days: - Update table ALIGN if hold date expired
                      - Synchronize table ALIGN_DBENTRY with DBENTRY
                      - warn a curator if an acc_number is no longer public
                      - check wich alignments can be published on the ftp site
		      - remove from the ftp if the entry_status = D
		      - Change the unpublished statment from Y 
		        to N if a citation becomes published.  
-> create into the ftp site: accession number.dat (e.g ALIGN_000001.dat)
                   clustal-> accession number.aln (e.g ALIGN_000001.aln)
-> send every day a status mail to datasub

journal_check_align.pl <username/password\@instance>

-> checks every days the citation status
-> send every 6 months a reminder letter (only 3 reminder letters maximum)
-> send a letter for an accepted, unpublished or no plans to publish citation

curator can use an unloading program

unload_align.pl <username/password\@instance> <accession number> [-clustal]

-> unload an entry given an accession number (even if it's a confidential one)
-> save the flatfile into the current directory (e.g ALIGN_000001.dat)  
-> if option [-clustal] is selected: save the clustal format into the current
                                     directory (e.g ALIGN_000001.aln)

whodidit_align.pl <username/password\@instance> <alignacc#>

-> view the revision history of an accession number. It displays:
   date, #ds, table, user, action, audit remark for each modification

stat_align.pl <username/password\@instance> [-d year]

-> dislpays the number of : - all alignments, 
			    - all protein alignments, 
			    - all DNA alignments,
                            - all confidential alignments, 
			    - confidential DNA alignments, 
			    - confidential protein alignments,
			    - deleted alignments.
for cumulative years or for a specific year (using the optional -d flag)
