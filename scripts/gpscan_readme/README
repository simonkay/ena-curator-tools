In entries.txt there will be a file listing all the entries you have submitted 
to EMBL-bank.  This file is updated each time new data is submitted to your 
project and also at 23.30 every Friday night.

Column 1: AC: This is the accession of your entry i.e the EMBL-bank identifier.
Once the entry has gone public (as defined by the date you entered in the DT 
field of your entry), the accession will also become available at Genbank (US) 
and DDBJ (JP) nucleotide sequence databases.

Column 2: AC *: This is the internal identifier you used to identifier your 
entry.

Column 3: State: This is the status of your entry which can be 'Unfinished' 
or 'Finished'.

Column 4: First Public: This is the date the entry is first visible to the 
public.

Column 5: Entry Status: This tells you what the status of your entry is in 
EMBL-bank. It can be:

	- draft (still being modified)

	- private (complete but not viewable by the public until the 
          release date is reached)

	- public (viewable by the public)

	- cancelled (the entry will no longer become public)

	- killed (the entry was once public but has been permanently removed, 
          perhaps because it has been replaced by another identical entry)

	- suppressed (the entry was once public but has been temporarily taken 
          from public view)
